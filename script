"Yeah, there's this one series about a young wizard and his adventures. I've read the entire series multiple times. It never gets old."

Katherine nodded in agreement.

"I know what you mean. There's something magical about immersing yourself in a well-crafted story."

As the conversation flowed, we exchanged stories about our favorite books, movies, and even childhood memories. It felt as though we were two kids, lost in our own little world, away from all the worries and responsibilities of adulthood.

"And what about you, Katherine?"

She smiled, her eyes glinting with enthusiasm.

"Well, I'll try my best. It's a way for me to express myself and see the beauty in the world."

Our conversation continued, each revelation bringing us closer together. It was a simple yet profound moment of connection, where two souls opened up to each other, sharing their dreams, fears, and aspirations.

As the time went on, we explored the different attractions, trying our luck at carnival games and enjoying the live performances. We shared our dreams and aspirations, talking about what we wanted to achieve in the future.

"Tony, I really admire your determination." 

Katherine said, looking at me with admiration in her eyes. 

"You've been through so much, yet you still keep going. It's inspiring."

Her words touched my heart, and I felt a surge of gratitude towards her. 

Name field: Douglas.

"Thank you, Katherine. You've been a true friend to me, and I can't express how much it means to have you by my side."

As the sun began to set, we found ourselves at the top of the Ferris wheel again. This time, the view was even more magical, with the city lights twinkling like stars below us.

"Tony, today has been one of the best days of my life,"

 Katherine said, her voice soft and sincere. 

"Thank you for sharing this experience with me."

Name field: Douglas.

"I feel the same way. It's been a day filled with laughter, joy, and unforgettable moments."

As we descended from the Ferris wheel, we walked hand in hand, cherishing the remaining moments of our day together. The park was now lit up with dazzling lights, creating a fairytale-like ambiance.

In that moment, I came to appreciate the joy of sharing experiences with someone else. It made me realize that this was something I had been missing, and Katherine had filled that void in the most incredible way. I felt indebted to her for bringing such happiness into my life, and I knew that repaying her for this invaluable gift would be a challenge I couldn't easily overcome.

As the night drew to a close, we sat on a bench near the entrance, gazing up at the starry sky. The day had been perfect, and I couldn't have asked for a better companion to share it with.



Scene 5: End of Prologue



After spending an exhilarating day at the theme park, Katherine and I found a secluded bench away from the bustling crowd but it’s not like the theme park was populated which was probably due to the news. 

Feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness, I decided to take the initiative and buy us some food. 

Name field: Douglas.

“You don’t look like you can take another step, Katherine. I'll get you some snacks and drinks this time.”

With a warm smile, Katherine's eyes met mine. 

Name field: Katherine
Character 1: Katherine. Pose: Standing. Expression: Smile. 

"Thanks, Tony. I'll wait here." 

Her fingers gently brushed against my arm, a subtle gesture that spoke more than words ever could.

As I walked away to fetch the snacks, my mind was filled with thoughts of making this moment special for Katherine.

Amidst all the fun we were having, it completely slipped my mind to mention that my name isn't actually Tony. I figured I would tell her later when the time was right.

That was really fun… 

Afterward, I made the decision to purchase two canned drinks and some delectable snacks that caught my eye as I perused the shelves of the convenience mall and returned with the food in hand.

Name field: Douglas.

“I am back, Katherine…?” 

There, standing beside Katherine, was a figure draped in shadows, its towering presence sending an eerie chill through the air. Its features were obscured, hidden beneath a shroud of darkness that seemed to writhe and coil like living smoke.

Next to Katherine's lifeless body stood a dark and eerie figure, dressed in mostly-black clothes. The fabric clung to him, creating uneven shapes that looked like ghostly figures. His clothes seemed to absorb the light around him, making him stand out against the surroundings. He wore a black outfit adorned with intricate designs that suggested a world beyond reality. These designs were made up of symbols that hinted at ancient and powerful meanings.

However, amidst the aura of intimidation he emanated, there was a subtle tremor—an almost imperceptible quiver in his stance. The hands, swathed in obsidian gloves that seemed to meld into the very essence of his attire, twitched involuntarily. Though the figure exuded an air of otherworldly dominance, there was a crack in the facade—a fracture that betrayed a hidden vulnerability. The fingers curled and uncurled, the slight tremble belying an underlying unease that dared not surface.

No way… It’s the…

Name field: Douglas.

“Sadistic Genius Killer—”

My words escaped involuntarily from my lips, driven by fear.

And then, in an instant that seemed to stretch into eternity, the figure’s hands were inside Katherine's chest with a sickening squelch. The sound was nauseatingly vivid—a wet, gruesome noise that echoed in my mind as her body convulsed.

I squeezed my chest, as if mirroring the pain, agony, and sense of death.

Blood erupted from Katherine's mouth, painting her lips and chin a deep, visceral red. Her eyes widened in shock and agony, reflecting the unimaginable horror of the moment. The glistening crimson liquid cascaded down her chin in rivulets, staining her clothing in a grotesque display.

My heart sank, and frustration coursed through my veins like an unstoppable wave. My hands trembled as the food fell to the ground, forgotten and useless. Panic and helplessness washed over me like a torrential rainstorm. 

My senses were overwhelmed by a mixture of fear and disbelief as I struggled to process the scene unfolding before me. The enigmatic figure's hands were raised, fingers contorted into an unnatural arrangement, as if wielding some dark and forbidden power.

And within the confines of my mind, there existed only a single utterance, a solitary expression that surged forth relentlessly, regardless of circumstance.

Whywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhy?!

As her body went limp, the figure withdrew its hand, and I could see a pulsating organ clutched in its grasp—the heart, still beating weakly. The smell of iron filled the air, mingling with the acrid scent of fear. The figure's aura seemed to intensify, a malevolent energy that seemed to revel in the brutality of its actions.

I stood frozen, paralyzed by a mixture of terror and disbelief, unable to tear my gaze away from the horrifying tableau before me. Katherine's lifeless form slumped to the ground, her eyes staring blankly into nothingness, her body surrounded by a pool of her own blood. 

My body heaved with an uncontrollable force, a violent upheaval that began deep within my gut and traveled up my esophagus with an unrelenting intensity. The acrid taste of bile and the sour remnants of my last meal clawed at my throat, demanding to be expelled. In a desperate bid for release, my mouth opened involuntarily, and a rush of stomach contents surged forth in a wave of repulsion.

I—I have to fight back!

With clenched fists, I rushed towards the murderer, my mind racing with a million thoughts and emotions colliding inside me. 

I summoned every vestige of determination within me, channeling the raw currents of frustration and fear into a laser-focused resolve. The enigma of the man's powers might have defied the bounds of reason, but my determination to unearth a weakness burned brighter than ever. As his attention fixed upon Katherine's lifeless form, an electric surge of adrenaline coursed through my veins, heightening my senses and sharpening my instincts.

As I charged toward him, my fists clenched, his gaze immediately locked onto me. A disturbing presence seemed to envelop him, a malevolent force moving within him, a sensation I could perceive in the atmosphere but couldn't quite see with my eyes.

Abruptly, the sensation of collision with a solid object brushed against me, prompting me to try evading, yet I couldn't escape the impact striking my arm. 

Name field: Douglas.

“Ugh!”

The force resembled that of a bulldozer crashing into me, prompting an involuntary cry to escape my lips.

...What on earth was that?

Once more, that very same sensation was lingering in the air.

Will this be where my life ends? I am not giving up without a fight!

As I attempt to flee, waves of imperceptible assaults pass through me, and I manage to narrowly evade them, my heart racing with apprehension.

What can I possibly do in this situation? Evading these attacks is already a challenge, made even more daunting by my inability to pinpoint their origin.

[ Choices ]

1. Gradually approach him and seize the opportunity to strike.

As I cautiously advance, my senses on high alert, I watch for the moment when his control over those elusive creatures falters. The tension in the air is palpable, and my heart pounds with a mix of fear and determination. His focus seems unwavering as he manipulates those worm-like entities with an eerie ease, causing them to slice through the air in unpredictable patterns.

I wait for the opportune instant, my muscles tensed and ready to strike. Suddenly, a lapse in his concentration causes the creatures to hesitate, and in that fleeting moment, I launch myself forward with all the strength I can muster. I swing my arm, aiming to disable his control, but just as I think I've succeeded—

"—!?"

—a sharp impact jolts me from behind, sending a surge of pain through my body. I grit my teeth, cursing my miscalculation.

2. Surge forward as soon as his attacks go amiss.

Observing his pattern, I sense a gap in his barrage of attacks, a fraction of time when his grip on those invisible creatures wavers. Without hesitation, I propel myself forward, my determination fueling my movements. It's a risk, a daring gambit, but I can't afford to waste this chance.

He is wide open!

I close the distance in a heartbeat, my arms ready to strike. But as I move in, a sudden, searing pain lances through my side. 

"U—Agh!"

I gasp, my momentum disrupted as I stumble back, my vision momentarily blurred by the unexpected assault. My heart pounds as I realize that even in his moments of weakness, he's still a formidable adversary.

[ End Choices ]

My body aches intensely, as though I've been struck by a colossal force. 

Oh no. I have to stay in motion or I won't be able to avoid them. Stay focused! I have to pay attention to the noises... There it is—the sound of air rushing, it's approaching!

Swiftly, I shifted to the side and sprinted toward him.

A single instant.

It's the window I've been waiting for. I must outsmart him entirely in this solitary moment. I have to employ every ounce of my resources. Just a single second to strategize. I can't afford to meet my end here.

As I ran, time seemed to slow, each heartbeat echoing like a war drum in my ears. I scrutinized his movements with the precision of a hawk tracking its prey, dissecting every nuance, every subtlety. His patterns, the subtle shifts of his body, the cadence of his breath—all became a symphony of information that I conducted in my mind.

It was as though my perception had expanded to encompass every element, leaving no detail obscure or unclear. Perhaps fueled by adrenaline, I recognized the urgency to harness it in that moment.

As my heart pounded within my chest, my senses seemed to synchronize with this rhythm, my mind becoming a conductor orchestrating a symphony of data. In that charged moment, my focus narrowed solely onto him, each detail etched into my consciousness.

Then, it happened—an infinitesimal shift, so subtle that it would have gone unnoticed by an ordinary observer. His gaze flickered, just for an instant, looking at someone even I had no time to know. It was a brief crack in his facade, a microcosmic tremor in the armor he wielded.

With the swiftness born of determination, I surged forward, a surge of energy propelling me toward the very flaw I had discerned, and—

—I threw the dust I took off the ground towards him.

Pose: Standing. Expression: Surprised. 

“—!” 

Once more, those entities began to stir, attempting to shield him, but their efforts proved futile and untimely. I was already sensing them, and I managed to narrowly evade those things in a split second behind me.

Name field: Douglas.

“Take this!”

In that split second of errors, I quickly struck him with the rock in my hand.

Even though I had landed a hit, his face remained oddly calm, as if my attack had no impact. He swayed slightly, locking eyes with me. In that moment, a flicker of recognition ignited in his gaze, as if he had encountered a challenger who wouldn't succumb to his malevolence.

At last, a crack appeared in his emotionless facade, revealing a glimpse of his true feelings.

Triumph surged through me, but it faded as his power struck back. A shockwave from him crashed like a wall, the impact searing with his overwhelming force.

And as I try to alleviate the pain and regain my composure, his lips eventually spoke—

Name field: Sadistic Genius Killer
Pose: Standing. Expression: Calm. 

"Remarkable. My ability is nearly impossible to evade unless you're 0.01 seconds quicker... unless you possess it as well."

Name field: Douglas.

"What do you mean? Why are you doing this?! Why did you have to take the life of a kind and innocent girl?!"

Name field: Sadistic Genius Killer
Pose: Standing. Expression: Calm. 

"She is far too late." 

He responded cryptically, his words sending chills down my spine.

As my senses fought to return, the man's gaze met mine, devoid of emotion, yet radiating malevolent intent.

With a final surge, those worm-like creatures sprang out from his body, inches away from delivering a fatal blow.

Just as his hand reached out, a blur of movement caught my attention. 

He jumped backwards from something so far away that I felt he wasn't even close to me in the first place.

Name field: Sadistic Genius Killer
Pose: Standing. Expression: Calm. 

“—...—!... So you’ve also come?”

Another figure, which I could not see clearly in the dark, appeared out of nowhere, intercepting the man's deadly strike. The clash of their powers created a chaotic maelstrom of energy, and I could only watch in awe and desperation.

But their battle immediately left us and then, silence came.

I found myself on my knees, gasping for breath. The world around me had blurred into a haze, and all I could see was the lifeless form of the figure who had intervened on my behalf. My heart sank as realization set in.

I was alone, utterly alone in my struggle. My fists clenched, and tears welled up in my eyes as a mix of grief, anger, and helplessness surged within me.

At that moment, I felt like a pawn in a game I couldn't comprehend. The enormity of the situation weighed heavily on my shoulders, and I could only watch, battered and bruised, as events unfolded beyond my control.

Clutching Katherine's unmoving form, I seethed with a furious determination that replaced the helplessness I had felt just moments ago. Not only did I fixate my anger on the enigmatic man who had orchestrated this tragedy, but I also channeled it inward, berating myself for my perceived weakness and inadequacy.

Crawling forward, my body trembling with a mixture of sorrow and rage, I couldn't help but taste the bitterness of my own limitations. The bitter tang of frustration mingled with the saltiness of tears streaming down my face as I clung desperately to the lifeless body before me. 

The very thought of not being able to shield the one I held dear, the one who had stood by me through thick and thin, fueled the flames of my anguish.

Name field: Douglas.

"DAMN IIIIIIT!" 

I roared, my voice echoing through the desolate surroundings. My cries were an outpouring of pent-up agony and a declaration of my torment.

Regret gnawed at my heart like a relentless predator, clawing away at my sanity. The realization that my negligence had led to this heart-wrenching loss weighed heavily upon me. The knowledge that I had failed to be vigilant, that I hadn't safeguarded the person who meant the world to me, was a wound that cut deep.

Tears flowed unabated down my cheeks, as I extended my apology to Katherine, even though her senses were forever silenced. 

The crushing weight of guilt and remorse threatened to consume me whole, leaving me feeling utterly powerless to mend the shattered pieces of this tragedy.

In the haze of my grief, I reflected on the missed chances, the words left unspoken, the opportunity to reveal my true self now cruelly snatched away. My vision blurred, the world around me becoming a distant blur as fatigue and despair overtook me. 

Name field: Douglas.

 "I will make him pay... for you, Katherine... I swear."

With a last, feeble effort, I strained my weakening eyes to witness Katherine's form fading away, vanishing into the ether like ashes carried away by the wind before my eyes met the darkness.
